Inspired by vcv rack and ableton live, the goal of this project is to create a full featured virtual rack with a modern, simple user interface, to be used for music production and live music performance. It will be modular by design; base rack modules (effects, generators, instrument inputs) can be composed to make higher order modules, which can be saved and reused throughout a project. There will also be modules for mastering, track-based recording, and BabylonJS integrated  visualization for live performance visuals.
